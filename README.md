# Statistical Analysis and Learning Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of Jupyter notebooks covering fundamental to advanced statistical concepts, implementations, and analyses. It serves as both a learning resource and a reference for statistical methods in data science.

## üéØ Overview

The notebooks in this repository provide hands-on implementations and explanations of statistical concepts, progressing from basic descriptive statistics to advanced topics like hypothesis testing and regression analysis. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained while building upon previous concepts.

  - Measures of central tendency
  - Variability measures
  - Distribution analysis

- **Combinatorics** (`abc_02_combinatorics.ipynb`)
  - Permutations
  - Combinations
  - Probability fundamentals

- **Probability Distributions** (`abc_03_distributions.ipynb`)
  - Normal distribution
  - Binomial distribution
  - Other common distributions

- **Sampling Methods** (`abc_04_sampling.ipynb`, `sampling.ipynb`)
  - Random sampling techniques
  - Sample size determination
  - Central Limit Theorem applications

- **Hypothesis Testing** (`abc_05_hypothesis_testing.ipynb`)
  - T-tests
  - Chi-square tests
  - ANOVA
  - Multiple testing corrections (FWER, FDR)

- **Regression Analysis** (`abc_06_regression.ipynb`)
  - Linear regression
  - Multiple regression
  - Gradient descent implementation
